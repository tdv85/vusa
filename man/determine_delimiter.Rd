\title{Determine the Delimiter of a File}
\usage{
determine_delimiter(file_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{A character string specifying the path to the file.}
}
\value{
A character string indicating the delimiter used in the file.
Returns "," if commas are detected, ";" if semicolons are detected,
and stops with an error message if neither is detected.
}
\description{
This function attempts to determine the delimiter of a file by inspecting
the first few lines. It checks for the presence of commas or semicolons.
However, this method may not always be accurate, especially if the data
itself contains these characters or if the file uses a different delimiter.
}
\note{
This method is not foolproof and may not accurately determine the delimiter
for all files, especially if the delimiter is not consistently used or if
the data contains the delimiter characters. This function is intended for
text files containing delimited data and is not suitable for binary data files
}

# Example usage
